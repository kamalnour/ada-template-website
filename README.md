# Maslow's Redefinition

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs serves as a model for assessing human behavior, offering insights into the profound shifts witnessed during the pandemic. From altered relationship dynamics to revised safety measures and changing professional priorities, our needs underwent a transformative evolution. 
The pivotal consideration lies in whether the data collected during this critical period truly encapsulates our emotions and intuitions. Is it aligned with Maslow's enduring theory, a testament to its continued dominance in shaping our daily lives? 

Our study delves into the pandemic-induced changes, exploring whether Maslow's framework remains a relevant and accurate tool for understanding these shifts. Our research only encompasses EU countries. By examining the intricacies of the data at hand, we aim to uncover the resonance between our evolving needs and the timeless principles outlined by Maslow's Hierarchy, providing a nuanced perspective on the enduring impact of his theory.
